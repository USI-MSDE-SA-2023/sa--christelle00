## ADR #1

1. Solution in the form of a website

2. Context

Clients need a way of getting automatically new articles related to food safety every day so that they do not have to do it manually anymore. 
The choice of the form of the product will influence the whole system and will influence which technologies to use.

One constraint is that people working at the FSVO  can't download anything easily on their work computer for security reasons. 
Also, the product should not be made available for everybody, but only for the FSVO.

3. Problem

In what form should the customer's needs be met?

4. Alternatives

* Website
* Software to download on the devices at work 
* Software to download on private devices (tablet, mobile phone)

5. Choice

The website alternative has been chosen.

6. Reason

The website alternative has been chosen as it is the one creating the least difficulties, both in terms of administration (alternative 2) and development (alternative 3). 
Indeed, if option 3 had been chosen, it would have been necessary to ensure that the program was compatible with all types of devices and operating systems.

Also, in order for the product not to be available for everybody, a login is required to enter the website, but no possibility to register. 
That way, only authorized people from the FSVO can access it, and efficiency wonâ€™t be reduced because of the traffic of other people. 

Advantages:
* Respects constraints
* Available from everywhere
* Web development architectures are well-known
* No need to take into account many types of devices or operating systems.
